RTraCe object current format:
list
Slot 1: Main Table
Slot 2: List of tables of correspondence (named according to the variable name defined)
Slot 3: Table with segments (Cell, V, D, J, chain type, productive) NOT YET IMPLEMENTED



TODO:
  - igraph network of clonotypes (chains and their productivity for edges)
    - this might be done as one of those cool networks in shiny
  - implement shiny explorer
  - V(D)J decomposition
  - V(D)J to sequence conversion
    - add sequence translation?
  - dim red for TCR chains in every cell?
    - take into account expression? of all or each segment?
  - calculate distance between cells on TCR space (similar to distance between genomes?)
  - run TraCeR from R
  .
  .
  .
  - implement for BraCeR?
